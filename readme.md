# Inception - Docker Multi-Container Environment

## 42 School Project Requirements
- Custom Dockerfiles only (no Docker Hub images)
- HTTPS-only web server (port 443)
- WordPress + PHP-FPM
- MariaDB database
- Nginx reverse proxy


## Architecture
```
Internet → Nginx (443/HTTPS) → WordPress (PHP-FPM) → MariaDB
```

## Environment Setup

### VM/Production Setup (With Sudo)
For final testing and evaluation with sudo privileges:
```bash
# Add domain to system hosts
echo "127.0.0.1 rlane.42.fr" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts

# Standard HTTPS port 443
# URLs: https://rlane.42.fr
        https://static.42.fr
        https://adminer.42.fr
        https://tinyapi.42.fr

```

``

## Development Notes
- Domain: rlane.42.fr
- All configuration via environment variables in srcs/.env
- Graceful container shutdown implemented
- SSL certificates auto-generated by mkcert

# FTP Access (with Port Forwarding)
- Forward port 2121 (to 21) and the passive port range (e.g., 21000-21001) from host to VM.
- Example: In VirtualBox, add port forwarding rules for 21 and 21000–21010.
- Connect from host: `ftp 127.0.0.1 2121` or ftp localhost 2121

to get ip on vm (not necessary but useful):
ip addr show | grep 'inet ' | grep -v '127.0.0.1' | awk '{print $2}'
